# Machine-Learning
This repository contains all my code for various machine learning models built from scratch and several techniques

### I've implemented the following machine learning models from scratch in Python:
* Linear Regression
* Multivariate Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM)
* K Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
